- Add more examples
- Work on thread fiber queue benchmarking, performance
- Update latency tests for queues, use histogram to better see results
- better Req/reply tests
- re-look at Pool fiber and design/contention
- consider re-design of Req/Reply interface
- create pool for thread pool fibers to improve instantiation time for some situations
- add multi producer tests
- minimize allocations
- move things outside core functionality to Extras library
- consider async/await for request reply
- event aggregator to simplify per type pub/sub and subscribing...
- look at using other implementations of thread pool that people have created
