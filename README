Fibrous
=======

High performace concurrency library for the .Net platform.  Fibrous is a fork of Retlang [http://code.google.com/p/retlang/]. 

Fibrous uses the concept of Fibers and Ports as abstractions.  Fibers represent execution contexts (aka thread/actor) and Ports represent messaging end points.  Channels are in memory conduits, but ports can be implemented on top of network sockets.

A CrossroadsIO based library for remoting is provided.  

Some of the library benefits:
 - Tiny library that makes multi-threading simple
 - UI fibers for worry free UI marshalling
 - Excellent batching support
 - UI throttling and redraw can be controlled easily
 - Build micro-services
