Fibrous
=======

High performace message passing concurrency library for the .Net platform.  

Fibrous is a fork of Retlang [http://code.google.com/p/retlang/], and has a very similar Api.  

Fibrous uses the concept of Fibers and Ports as abstractions.  Fibers represent execution contexts (aka thread/actor) and Ports represent messaging end points.  Channels are in memory conduits, but ports can be implemented on top of network sockets.

Some of the library benefits:
 - Small simple library 
 - UI thread/dispatcher marshalling
 - Good batched subscription support
 - UI throttling and redraw can be controlled easily

A CrossroadsIO based library for ports over sockets is provided.
